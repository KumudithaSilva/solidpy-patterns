# ðŸŽ¨ Design Patterns Overview

Design patterns are common solutions to recurring problems in software design. They are grouped into three main categories:

---

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Creational Design Patterns</strong> â€“ Manage object creation mechanisms.</summary>

These patterns abstract the instantiation process and make it more flexible and reusable.

- **1.1 Singleton Pattern**  
  Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

- **1.2 Factory Method Pattern**  
  Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

- **1.3 Builder Pattern**  
  Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

<summary><strong>2. Structural Design Patterns</strong> â€“ Focus on class and object composition.</summary>

They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesnâ€™t need to do the same.

- **2.1 Adapter Pattern**  
  Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Behavioral Design Patterns</strong> â€“ Improve object interaction and communication.</summary>

These patterns are concerned with communication between objects and responsibilities.

- **3.1 Strategy Pattern**  
  Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

- **3.2 Observer Pattern**  
  Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

- **3.3 State Pattern**  
  Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
