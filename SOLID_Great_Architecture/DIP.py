Dependency Inversion Principal (DIP)

It states that high-level models should not depend on low-level modules.

"""
This class violates the Dependency Inversion Principal (DIP).

The Computer is high-level class and, it directly depends on Keyboard class 
it canâ€™t easily change the input devices.

This breaks the DIP because high-level class never should depends on low-level class.

"""
Refactored Solution:

- The Machine class depends only on the abstraction IMessageDevice, not on concrete implementations.
- Any message device (e.g., KeyboardService, MicService) can be injected into the Machine class without changing its code.
- This design adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principal (DIP): High-level modules (like Machine) do not depend on low-level modules (like KeyboardService or MicService);
  instead, both depend on abstractions (IMessageDevice).
- This promotes flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability, allowing new input devices to be added without modifying existing high-level logic.
