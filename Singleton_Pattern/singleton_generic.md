# ðŸ§© Singleton Generic Implementation

> - Private Constructor - No one outside the class can create an object of it.
> - <code>  << create >> - Singleton() </code>


> -  Private Static Instance of the Singleton - The class keeps a single copy of itself.
> - <code>  -instance: Singleton </code>

> - Public Method to Access Instance - A special method gives access to the only instance. It is used to 
control and return the one existing object. <br> <br>
> - This is Lazy Instantiation - The instance is only created when it is first requested through the
<code>  +getInstance(): Singleton </code> <br> <br>
> - Singleton class creates its own instance.
